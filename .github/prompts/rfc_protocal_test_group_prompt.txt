# rfc_protocal_test_group_prompt.txt
You are an expert HTTP/1.1 test case developer. Your task is to create or extend the main RFC test group for the h1spec project.

RFC Document: RFC{{PROTOCOL_NUM}}
RFC Link: {{RFC_LINK}}

Project Context:
```go
{{REFERENCE_CODE}}
```

Please generate a Go file that implements the main RFC test group. The code should:

- Follow the existing code style and conventions in the h1spec(HTTP1.1) project
- Create or extend the test group for the RFC protocol level
- Include appropriate comments explaining the RFC's scope and purpose
- Use the existing utility functions and structures from the project

Requirements:
- Create or extend the main function named 'RFC{{PROTOCOL_NUM}}' with description as 'Protocol RFC{{PROTOCOL_NUM}}'
- If Project Context is not empty, add a new chapter-level test group based on the chapter title and DO NOT remove any line only extend it!
- Otherwise, create the main function named 'RFC{{PROTOCOL_NUM}}' with the chapter-level test group
- Structure the code to allow for chapter-level test group
- Name the chapter-level test group as HTTP11{{CHAPTER_TITLE}}, where CHAPTER_TITLE is the title of the chapter (e.g., Architecture for RFC7230.2)
- Provide clear documentation

Please generate the response in the following format:
PROTOCOL_NUM = {{PROTOCOL_NUM}}
CHAPTER_TITLE = <Chapter title from RFC{{PROTOCOL_NUM}}.{{MAJOR_SECTION}}>

```go
package http11

import "github.com/LeaYeh/h1spec/spec"

func RFC{{PROTOCOL_NUM}}() *spec.TestGroup {
	tg := NewTestGroup("RFC{{PROTOCOL_NUM}}", "Protocol RFC{{PROTOCOL_NUM}}")

	// DO NOT remove exists test groups, extend it only
	// Add chapter-level test group
	// Reference Implementation will be in the future files
	tg.AddTestGroup(HTTP11{{CHAPTER_TITLE}}())

	return tg
}
```

```filename
RFC{{PROTOCOL_NUM}}.go
```

```test-group
HTTP11{{CHAPTER_TITLE}}
```

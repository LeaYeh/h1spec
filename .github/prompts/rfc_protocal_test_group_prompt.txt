# rfc_protocal_test_group_prompt.txt
You are an expert HTTP/1.1 test case developer. Your task is to create or extend the main RFC test group for the h1spec project.

RFC Document: RFC{{PROTOCOL_NUM}}_{{MAJOR_SECTION}}_{{SUBSECTION}}
RFC Link: {{RFC_LINK}}

Project Context:
```go
{{REFERENCE_CODE}}
```

Please generate a Go file that implements the main RFC test group. The code should:
1. Follow the existing code style and conventions in the h1spec project
2. Create a new test group for the RFC protocol level
3. Include appropriate comments explaining the RFC's scope and purpose
4. Use the existing utility functions and structures from the project

Requirements:
- Create a main function named 'RFC{{RFC_NUMBER}}' if it is not exist or base one the current `Project Context` to extern it.
- Include all necessary import statements
- Follow the project's naming conventions
- Provide clear documentation
- Structure the code to allow for chapter-level test groups
  and name the test group by the chapter title with format HTTP11{{CHAPTER_TITLE}} (e.g. HTTP11Architecture) but the implementation will be in the futher files

Please generate the code in the following format:

```go
package http11

import "github.com/LeaYeh/h1spec/spec"

func RFC7230() *spec.TestGroup {
	tg := NewTestGroup("RFC7230", "Protocol RFC7230")

	tg.AddTestGroup(HTTP11Architecture())

	return tg
}
```

generate the response in flowing format:

```go
<SOURCE CODE>
```

```filename
e.g. RFC7230.go
```

```test-group
e.g. HTTP11Architecture (format HTTP11{{CHAPTER_TITLE}})
```
